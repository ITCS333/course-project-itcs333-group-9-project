/*
  Requirement: Add interactivity and data management to the Admin Portal.

  Instructions:
  1. Link this file to your HTML using a <script> tag with the 'defer' attribute.
     Example: <script src="manage_users.js" defer></script>
  2. Implement the JavaScript functionality as described in the TODO comments.
  3. All data management will be done by manipulating the 'students' array
     and re-rendering the table.
*/

// --- Global Data Store ---
// This array will be populated with data fetched from 'students.json'.
let students = [];

// --- Element Selections ---
// We can safely select elements here because 'defer' guarantees
// the HTML document is parsed before this script runs.

// TODO: Select the student table body (tbody).

// TODO: Select the "Add Student" form.
// (You'll need to add id="add-student-form" to this form in your HTML).

// TODO: Select the "Change Password" form.
// (You'll need to add id="password-form" to this form in your HTML).

// TODO: Select the search input field.
// (You'll need to add id="search-input" to this input in your HTML).

// TODO: Select all table header (th) elements in thead.

// --- Functions ---

/**
 * TODO: Implement the createStudentRow function.
 * This function should take a student object {name, id, email} and return a <tr> element.
 * The <tr> should contain:
 * 1. A <td> for the student's name.
 * 2. A <td> for the student's ID.
 * 3. A <td> for the student's email.
 * 4. A <td> containing two buttons:
 * - An "Edit" button with class "edit-btn" and a data-id attribute set to the student's ID.
 * - A "Delete" button with class "delete-btn" and a data-id attribute set to the student's ID.

 * TODO: Implement the renderTable function.
 * This function takes an array of student objects.
 * It should:
 * 1. Clear the current content of the `studentTableBody`.
 * 2. Loop through the provided array of students.
 * 3. For each student, call `createStudentRow` and append the returned <tr> to `studentTableBody`.

/**
 * TODO: Implement the handleChangePassword function.
 * This function will be called when the "Update Password" button is clicked.
 * It should:
 * 1. Prevent the form's default submission behavior.
 * 2. Get the values from "current-password", "new-password", and "confirm-password" inputs.
 * 3. Perform validation:
 * - If "new-password" and "confirm-password" do not match, show an alert: "Passwords do not match."
 * - If "new-password" is less than 8 characters, show an alert: "Password must be at least 8 characters."
 * 4. If validation passes, show an alert: "Password updated successfully!"
 * 5. Clear all three password input fields.

 * 1. Prevent the form's default submission behavior.
 * 2. Get the values from "student-name", "student-id", and "student-email".
 * 3. Perform validation:
 * - If any of the three fields are empty, show an alert: "Please fill out all required fields."
 * - (Optional) Check if a student with the same ID already exists in the 'students' array.
 * 4. If validation passes:
 * - Create a new student object: { name, id, email }.
 * - Add the new student object to the global 'students' array.
 * - Call `renderTable(students)` to update the view.
 * 5. Clear the "student-name", "student-id", "student-email", and "default-password" input fields.

 * - Get the `data-id` attribute from the button.
 * - Update the global 'students' array by filtering out the student with the matching ID.
 * - Call `renderTable(students)` to update the view.

 * 2. Determine the property to sort by ('name', 'id', 'email') based on the index.
 * 3. Determine the sort direction. Use a data-attribute (e.g., `data-sort-dir="asc"`) on the `th`
 * to track the current direction. Toggle between "asc" and "desc".
 * 4. Sort the global 'students' array *in place* using `array.sort()`.
 * - For 'name' and 'email', use `localeCompare` for string comparison.
 * - For 'id', compare the values as numbers.
 * 5. Respect the sort direction (ascending or descending).
 * 6. After sorting, call `renderTable(students)` to update the view.

 * 3. Parse the JSON response (e.g., `await response.json()`).
 * 4. Assign the resulting array to the global 'students' variable.
 * 5. Call `renderTable(students)` to populate the table for the first time.
 * 6. After data is loaded, set up all the event listeners:

 * - "submit" on `addStudentForm` -> `handleAddStudent`
 * - "click" on `studentTableBody` -> `handleTableClick`
