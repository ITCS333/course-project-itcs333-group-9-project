  2. In `list.html`, add an `id="assignment-list-section"` to the
     <section> element that will contain the assignment articles.

  3. Implement the TODOs below.
*/

// --- Element Selections ---
// TODO: Select the section for the assignment list ('#assignment-list-section').

// --- Functions ---

/**
 * TODO: Implement the createAssignmentArticle function.
 * It takes one assignment object {id, title, dueDate, description}.
 * It should return an <article> element matching the structure in `list.html`.
 * The "View Details" link's `href` MUST be set to `details.html?id=${id}`.
 * This is how the detail page will know which assignment to load.

 * TODO: Implement the loadAssignments function.
 * This function needs to be 'async'.
 * It should:
 * 1. Use `fetch()` to get data from 'assignments.json'.
 * 2. Parse the JSON response into an array.
 * 3. Clear any existing content from `listSection`.
 * 4. Loop through the assignments array. For each assignment:
 * - Call `createAssignmentArticle()`.
 * - Append the returned <article> element to `listSection`.
