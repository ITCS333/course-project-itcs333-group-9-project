## Current State
The project is a GitHub Classroom assignment template. All HTML files contain TODO comments with instructions for students to complete the pages. The files are currently empty of actual content but have structural guidelines in the comments.

## Configuration

### Workflow
- **Name**: Server
- **Command**: `python3 -m http.server 5000`
- **Purpose**: Serves static HTML files on port 5000

### Deployment
- **Target**: Autoscale (suitable for static websites)
- **Run Command**: `python3 -m http.server`

## Development
This is a learning project where students need to:
1. Complete the index.html with proper navigation
2. Fill in all TODO items in each HTML page
3. Add styling (likely using a CSS framework like PicoCSS or Bootstrap)
4. Create functional forms and links between pages

## Notes
- No build process required (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- No dependencies or package manager needed
- Simple Python HTTP server is sufficient for development and deployment
- The site is currently showing blank pages because the HTML files only contain TODO comments
